I'm currently learning react on my own time. This was a great crash course for me. I'm trying to implement a hook that will display the parsed JSON. This isn't included in this project because I was out of time. I'm extremely confident I can learn this quickly on the job. Currently I have it outputting the hits in the console and inside an alert.
