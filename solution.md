I'm currently learning react on my own time. This was a great crash course for me. I'm trying to implement a hook that will display the parsed JSON. This isn't included in this project because I was out of time. I'm extremely confident I can learn this quickly on the job. Currently I have it outputting the hits in the console and inside an alert. I did find code to display the hit's on the page. But I didn't write it so I didn't want to use it. I could have modified it to do what i need it to do. (which i did butt isn't in this repository)
